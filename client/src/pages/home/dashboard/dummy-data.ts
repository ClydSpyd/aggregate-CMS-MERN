    caption:
      "The early to mid '80s was certainly a high point for hard rock and heavy metal – particularly, when you take into account the high amount of now-classic albums that were issued during this time",
    content:
      '<p>And one such album was <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ratt-mn0000340152">Ratt</a></strong>\'s full-length debut from 1984, <strong><em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.allmusic.com/album/out-of-the-cellar-mw0000191418">Out of the Cellar</a></em></strong>, which spawned such MTV/radio hits as "Round and Round," "Back for More," and "Wanted Man." With the album celebrating its 40th anniversary this year, BMG (in partnership with Rhino) is reissuing <em>Out of the Cellar</em> as a CD and limited edition vinyl version, both of which includes a previously unreleased track, "Reach for the Sky."<br><br>Just before the reissue\'s November 8, 2024 release date, Ratt singer <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.allmusic.com/artist/stephen-pearcy-mn0000022035">Stephen Pearcy</a></strong> spoke with AllMusic – discussing the album, the significance of the year in which it was originally released, and if the surviving Ratt members could ever reunite.<br><br><br><strong>How did the 40th anniversary edition of <em>Out of the Cellar</em> come about?</strong><br><br>"It was talked about months and months ago. And I got wind of it and thought, \'Wow…OK!\' Because the single that we released with it, I tried to get on the box set [<strong><em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-atlantic-years-1984-1990-mw0003350853">The Atlantic Years: 1984-1991</a></em></strong>] last year. But this song was written for <em>Out of the Cellar</em>, but never made the record. And I got it on there, finally. And I was very happy that I didn\'t go on the box set – we put \'Nobody Rides for Free\' on that one."<br><br><strong>How do you think that album holds up, listening to it 40 years later?</strong><br><br>"I think it holds up. All I would have done now – or <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.allmusic.com/artist/beau-hill-mn0000791198">Beau Hill</a></strong>, who produced it – was give it more volume. And that\'s what we keep trying to do when you remaster – give it more \'oomph.\' It sounds good. And it sounds better on the vinyl – analog."<br><br><strong>Do you agree that <em>Cellar</em> is the most consistent Ratt album front to back?</strong><br><br>"Yeah. We got close with <strong><em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.allmusic.com/album/invasion-of-your-privacy-mw0000195401">Invasion of Your Privacy</a></em></strong>, but <em>Cellar</em>…maybe because it was our debut and it kind of hit a nerve. It was hard to do <em>Invasion</em> – the next record. Because <em>Cellar</em> was everything you stood for. You worked for this all your life, and some of these songs on <em>Cellar</em> were ideas I had back in 1978 or something."<br><br><strong>Although "Round and Round" is the best known tune off <em>Cellar</em>, there are other Ratt classics on it, such as "Back for More" – which originally appeared on Ratt\'s self-titled EP, and was re-recorded for <em>Cellar</em>.</strong><br><br>"It was just a great song. And the reason why we put it on <em>Cellar</em> also – but they chopped it up – was because it was a great live song. It was part of our \'thing\' in \'83, and our audience and all of that. But that song, it morphed. It was another one of those songs like \'Round and Round\' – it wasn\'t all together, until Beau Hill got ahold of it. But we liked the long version on the EP. That\'s what I do live – Ratt from day one has always done the long version live."</p><p></p>',

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p><h3 data-level="3"><strong>Section 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45 BC</strong></h3><p>"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga.

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"',
